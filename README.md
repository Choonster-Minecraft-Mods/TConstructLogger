# Tinkers' Construct Logger
This is a small mod that dumps [Tinkers' Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct) tool materials to a CSV file so you can compare their properties in something like Excel.

## Setting up Forge Gradle
To set up Forge Gradle, run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace`.

To generate an IDE project, run `gradlew eclipse` (for Eclipse) or `gradlew idea` (for IntelliJ IDEA).

Run `gradlew build` to build the mod.
